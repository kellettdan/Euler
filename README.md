# Project Euler
# This repo contains code for solving problems sourced through the Project Euler website (https://projecteuler.net/)
# Note that in accordance with the website rules:
# Sharing solutions outside of Project Euler is not allowed however the first one-hundred problems may be to aims to instruct methods, 
# not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. 
# Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material and if you are able to respect our requirements, 
# then we give permission for those problems and their solutions to be discussed elsewhere.
